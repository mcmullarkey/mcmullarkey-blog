    "text": "How good is your favorite NBA team really? This is a surprisingly difficult question to answer!  I can already hear some people yelling “Scoreboard!” and pointing at readily available wins and losses for each team.   And even the most die-hard fans will admit their team sometimes gets lucky.1 A banked 3-pointer, an untimely injury to the opposing team’s star, and so much more can make the wins and losses less reliable than they first appear.   Folks have looked at a bunch of metrics to better quantify team quality outside of luck. Average point differential per 100 possessions, the 4 factors, and many more can give us a clearer guide to how good teams are. But what if we wanted to specifically quantify how lucky they’ve been?   A precise quantification of that isn’t going to happen, at least not at scale.2 But there are certain, easily measured metrics that seem to be more luck than skill-based.   Drawing on Seth Partnow’s The Midrange Theory and a myriad of Caitlin Cooper film deep-dives we’ll assume:  - Defenses don’t affect how well opponents shoot from 3 + Long 23  - Offenses built on high-volume, very high accuracy long 2s are less sustainable than other kinds of offense4  - Offenses built on high-volume, unassisted high accuracy 3s are less sustainable than other kinds of offense5   Then, we’ll explore which 2021-2022 NBA teams may have appeared better on offense and defense than they actually were."

These plots allow us to see defensive mirage tiers rather than hard and fast rankings. I like that this plot communicates the inherent uncertainty in these metrics in an interesting way.   From a basketball perspective, we can see you need to be lucky and good to be a top defense in the NBA. I don’t think anyone would argue that the Golden State Warriors had a bad defense last year, and their already excellent defense benefitted from a lot of poor opponent shooting luck.   A couple of teams with a larger gap between “the eye test” and their defensive ratings last season also show up among the luckiest teams on defense. Put it this way: I’m not betting on either the Mavs or the Knicks having a top-tier defense again in 2022-2023."

You can point to all the excellent shooting Atlanta had, and also recognize that some regression to the mean is likely in 2022-2023.   Same for Brooklyn and Chicago - two teams with absurdly elite midrange shooters that might still see a bit of regression in that category this year. Case in point, the Suns are also full of elite midrange shooters and are almost a full standard deviation below Chicago on the Long 2 mirage metric."

The pilot report could help identify potential pain points, let everyone breathe a sigh of relief, or1 a bit of both.   One problem: pilot reports before I arrived were redone by hand for every pilot. While some of the code from previous pilots could be copy/pasted that introduced a whole new set of issues. This ad-hoc approach meant each pilot report took almost a full work week to build.2   After I introduced ultra-parameterized reports, we were able to provide pilot reports the moment the data became available.3 Other decision-makers could react faster, and the company’s capacity to capitalize on the report grew a ton."

    "text": "Load Packages\nFirst we’ll import the packages we need. If you want to skip the local timezone wrangling part you can eliminate the datetime, pytz, and tzlocal dependencies.\n\n# Import packages, most for parsing the tweets.js file\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport duckdb\nimport json\nimport time\nimport datetime\nimport pytz\nfrom dateutil.tz import tzlocal\n\n\n\nParsing My Tweets Data\nWe’ll create a function to can load the tweets.js in as a pandas data frame. While the Javascript file was a little tricky at first I realized it was JSON with some extra text at the front.   Opening the file, removing that text, and then normalizing the JSON let’s us read in the tweets data as a Pandas Data Frame without too much fuss.\n\n# Adapting a parsing function from here but extended it to go into a DF \n# https://github.com/dangoldin/twitter-archive-analysis/blob/master/analyze.py\n\ndef load_tweets_from_js(js_file):\n    with open(js_file, \"r\") as f:\n        data = f.read()\n        data = data.replace(\"window.YTD.tweets.part0 = \", \"\")\n        tweets = json.loads(data)\n        for tweet in tweets:\n            ts = datetime.datetime.strptime(\n                tweet[\"tweet\"][\"created_at\"], \"%a %b %d %H:%M:%S +0000 %Y\"\n            )\n            ts = ts.replace(tzinfo=pytz.utc)\n            ts = ts.astimezone(tzlocal())\n            tweet[\"timestamp\"] = ts\n        print(\"Loaded %d tweets\" % len(tweets))\n        tweets_df = pd.json_normalize(tweets)\n        return tweets_df\n\n\n\nSome Initial Tidying with Pandas\nOne great aspect of using local data is we don’t have to abandon other tools we know and love to exclusively use SQL. For example, we can use Pythonic methods to rename all our columns in a way that won’t collide with the SQL interpreter5 in a single line of code.\n\n# Use the function to create a Pandas DataFrame\n\ntweets = load_tweets_from_js(\"tweets.js\")\n\n# Replace periods with underscores so they don't confuse SQL later\n\ntweets.columns = tweets.columns.str.replace(\".\", \"_\",regex = False)\n\n# Convert multiple columns to numeric at once\n# Only doing with two columns here but could work with many more\n\nsecret_numeric = [\"tweet_favorite_count\",\"tweet_retweet_count\"]\n\ntweets[secret_numeric] = tweets[secret_numeric].apply(pd.to_numeric)\n\n# Confirm the conversion worked (Commented out because it did!)\n# tweets.dtypes\n\nLoaded 5244 tweets\n\n\n\n\nAn Example DuckDB Query on a Pandas Data Frame\nNow we can use DuckDB as a querying engine directly on this pandas data frame!   Here’s a simple example to start, where we use DuckDB to (gulp) look at how many likes my tweets have gotten on average:\n\nprint(duckdb.query(\"SELECT AVG(tweet_favorite_count) as avg_favorite_count FROM tweets\").to_df())\n\n   avg_favorite_count\n0            5.127002\n\n\n\n\nComparing the Speed of DuckDB and Pandas on My Twitter Archive\nOk, so how long does this take on my non-enormous Twitter archive? Let’s create a timing function first.\n\ndef time_duckdb(full_query):\n  start = time.time()\n  duckb_query = duckdb.query(full_query).to_df()\n  end = time.time()\n  print(round(end - start, 4))\n\n\ntime_duckdb(\"SELECT AVG(tweet_favorite_count) as avg_favorite_count FROM tweets\")\n\n0.0507\n\n\nPretty quick! How does this simple DuckDB query compare to an equivalent Pandas operation?\n\nstart_pd_simple = time.time()\ntest_pandas_avg = tweets.agg(avg_favorite_count = (\"tweet_favorite_count\", \"mean\"))\nend_pd_simple = time.time()\nprint(round(end_pd_simple - start_pd_simple, 4))\n\n0.0039\n\n\nOn simple queries on non-enormous data6 Pandas seems to still be much faster than DuckDB. That lead would diminish and eventually disappear on larger data. \n\n\nSometime We Might Prefer to Write SQL\nAnd even if Pandas is faster on data of this size sometimes we might prefer to use DuckDB anyway.   For example, the syntax for doing a filtered “group by” using SQL is more intuitive to me than the equivalent Pandas syntax. Either works, and as we can see here Pandas is still faster on data at this size!\n\ntime_duckdb(\"SELECT AVG(tweet_favorite_count) as avg_favorite_count FROM tweets WHERE tweet_retweet_count > 10 GROUP BY tweet_truncated\")\n\n0.0497\n\n\n\nstart = time.time()\nfiltered_pandas = tweets[tweets[\"tweet_retweet_count\"] >= 1]\ngrouped_avg_pandas = filtered_pandas.groupby('tweet_truncated', as_index=False).agg(avg_favorite_count = (\"tweet_favorite_count\", \"mean\"))\nend = time.time()\nprint(round(end - start, 4))\n\n0.0057\n\n\nAnd since in this case the speed differential is negligible7 having another option for data wrangling can be handy.   DuckDB also has the virtue of being far more scalable than Pandas. That scalability extends to much larger data, much more complex data wrangling, and both of those complexities combined.\n\n\nConclusion\nI had a good time exploring a more compact use-case for DuckDB. I was a bit surprised how much faster the Pandas queries ran vs. DuckDB at “small-ish data” size. I figured the two appraoaches would be closer in speed, though this may be a quirk of running Python through Quarto.   I’m hoping this is just a warm-up act for my journey with DuckDB! I’m especially excited about DuckDB as a key catalyst for running the Modern Data Stack on a laptop, and if you’re also intrigued I recommend checking out this proof-of-concept by Jacob Matson.   If you have any questions or comments I’d love to hear from you! For at least a while I’m on Twitter, and other contact info is on my website.\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nData Mastodon? Data 138-Different-Discord-Servers?↩︎\nNo external dependencies like SQLite with a lot more features, thorough testing with CI, open source↩︎\nAs of me writing this I don’t believe you can work directly on data frames or tibble in R, though you can interface with DuckDB using the dbplyr package https://duckdb.org/docs/api/r↩︎\nOr maybe not, as we’ll see soon!↩︎\nReplacing all the “.” in variable names with “_” so the SQL interpreter doesn’t think we’re referencing a variable within another table↩︎\nIn this case ~10 MB↩︎\nBoth styles of queries are more than fast enough!↩︎"
