    "text": "How good is your favorite NBA team really? This is a surprisingly difficult question to answer!  I can already hear some people yelling “Scoreboard!” and pointing at readily available wins and losses for each team.   And even the most die-hard fans will admit their team sometimes gets lucky.1 A banked 3-pointer, an untimely injury to the opposing team’s star, and so much more can make the wins and losses less reliable than they first appear.   Folks have looked at a bunch of metrics to better quantify team quality outside of luck. Average point differential per 100 possessions, the 4 factors, and many more can give us a clearer guide to how good teams are. But what if we wanted to specifically quantify how lucky they’ve been?   A precise quantification of that isn’t going to happen, at least not at scale.2 But there are certain, easily measured metrics that seem to be more luck than skill-based.   Drawing on Seth Partnow’s The Midrange Theory and a myriad of Caitlin Cooper film deep-dives we’ll assume:  - Defenses don’t affect how well opponents shoot from 3 + Long 23  - Offenses built on high-volume, very high accuracy long 2s are less sustainable than other kinds of offense4  - Offenses built on high-volume, unassisted high accuracy 3s are less sustainable than other kinds of offense5   Then, we’ll explore which 2021-2022 NBA teams may have appeared better on offense and defense than they actually were."

These plots allow us to see defensive mirage tiers rather than hard and fast rankings. I like that this plot communicates the inherent uncertainty in these metrics in an interesting way.   From a basketball perspective, we can see you need to be lucky and good to be a top defense in the NBA. I don’t think anyone would argue that the Golden State Warriors had a bad defense last year, and their already excellent defense benefitted from a lot of poor opponent shooting luck.   A couple of teams with a larger gap between “the eye test” and their defensive ratings last season also show up among the luckiest teams on defense. Put it this way: I’m not betting on either the Mavs or the Knicks having a top-tier defense again in 2022-2023."

The Atlanta Hawks had the 2nd best offensive rating in the NBA during 2021-2022, and they had an absurdly high rate of accurate, unassisted 3 pointers. You can point to all the excellent shooting Atlanta had, and also recognize that some regression to the mean is likely in 2022-2023.   Same for Brooklyn and Chicago - two teams with absurdly elite midrange shooters that might still see a bit of regression in that category this year. Case in point, the Suns are also full of elite midrange shooters and are almost a full standard deviation below Chicago on the Long 2 mirage metric."
